# Iris Flower Classification 🌸

This project uses machine learning to classify Iris flower species based on four features:  
- Sepal length  
- Sepal width  
- Petal length  
- Petal width  

The model was trained on the classic [Iris dataset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set) using a **Random Forest Classifier** and achieved **100% accuracy** on the test set.
